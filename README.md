# k8vavoom extras

This repository contains freshly build binaries for K8Vavoom DooM sourceport as well as some files with additional info about the engine.

The binaries are built from the latest sources directly from repo, meaning there is no testing at all and no guarantie for them to work. If the current build is not working properly, use a previous one and open an issue, so the bad build can be removed.

The binaries are built for Windows x64 platform on Windows 10.   

The are also some docs on how to build k8vavoom under Windows and on k8vavoom 3d model definition XML format.
