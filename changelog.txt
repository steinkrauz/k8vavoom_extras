19:20:02 [1faff0cae7] models: some cosmetix and more sanity checks; hid lowest voxel optimisation levels (they are useless anyway) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
18:43:38 [d71a23e7dd] models: added t-junction fixer (and the corresponding option); also, it is now possible to change voxel optimisation level without restarting the engine (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
17:23:34 [22d99a8d11] models: added optional t-junction fixer to voxel converter (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
