15:55:08 [2cf78e4272] models: removed some wrong checking code; fixed edge and planes on-demand builder (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
14:08:03 [2c33d56e73] render: fixed model normal matrix calculations (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
14:07:32 [ea2a09c4f8] corelib: matrix recomposition microoptimisations (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
14:06:51 [75a8cac099] voxelib: fixed quad normal calculation i accdently in previous commits (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
14:05:24 [258aa2107a] shaders: cosmetix (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
11:33:53 [c0e397cb00] voxelib: faster quad normals generation (there is no need to calculate them at all) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)

21:44:35 [63878cc26f] render: restoring rendering of additive models (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
20:55:23 [c74e8e4223] Edit [6523dd08bd7af8b7|6523dd08bd]: Edit check-in comment. (user: ketmar)
19:31:55 [baf9e8469d] source: fixed some typos in comments (thanks, steinkrauz!) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
19:20:21 [6523dd08bd] models: fixed GZDoom multimodel frames (thanks, id0!); MODELDEF can attach many models to one frame, and Vavoom is using that for inter-frame models and interpolation; made that mutually exclusive (user:ketmar tags: trunk)
18:40:47 [240a38065f] model: added some hacks to GZDoom MODELDEF (allow more than one attached model to one sprite frame) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
18:11:29 [52f6d99f00] render: fixes in glass (translucent submodels on non-translucent models) rendering; they should be properly sorted now (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
16:43:52 [ac80a02bb5] render: tried to cache model transformations in advrender; for some reason it is even slower, lol (user: ketmar tags: advmodel_drawlist_cache)
04:23:39 [8d443baa9d] *BRANCH* script: added "MObj_State" cheat (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
02:35:10 [8f550c1fb7] voxelib: added comment about texture filtering (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
01:03:25 [ef0007f8df] render: forgot to set one var in "pushdlights" (mostly harmless, only causes some minor lighting visibility glitches) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
00:46:32 [d7996fd94e] voxelib: fixed stupid color atlas bug; some code refactoring (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
=== 2022-03-20 ===
18:59:16 [645b6731ea] voxelib: got rid of non-POD dynamic arrays (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
18:08:50 [f05ec7d7f1] voxelib: added KVX/KV6 loaders, and used them instead of loaders from "r_parse_kvx.cpp" (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
06:19:08 [26ba1b97e9] voxels: moved voxel conversion code to (almost) standalone library (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
05:41:57 [9b3c656e7e] corelib: some fixes, added `TArray::transferDataFrom()` (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
05:19:53 [6010bff0e3] vc: fixed `VMethod` ctor (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
=== 2022-03-18 ===
02:42:47 [e9669e7574] models: added some more class globals to xml, and used that in gz converter (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
01:50:54 [27a4294f49] model: xml and gz conversion cosmetix (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
01:17:34 [18e0a79b41] models: better converted gzdoom model dumping (use "+dbg_dump_gzmodels 1") (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
=== 2022-03-17 ===
22:12:01 [05e56fdce3] voxels: even more simplified t-junction fixer code (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
21:05:13 [8c0c8defe5] voxels: added one const ;-) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
20:59:16 [de667c3bd8] voxels: rewritten t-junction fixer: takes x4 less memory, faster, and fixes some bugs in the old one (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
19:20:02 [1faff0cae7] models: some cosmetix and more sanity checks; hid lowest voxel optimisation levels (they are useless anyway) (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
18:43:38 [d71a23e7dd] models: added t-junction fixer (and the corresponding option); also, it is now possible to change voxel optimisation level without restarting the engine (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
17:23:34 [22d99a8d11] models: added optional t-junction fixer to voxel converter (user: ketmar tags: trunk)
